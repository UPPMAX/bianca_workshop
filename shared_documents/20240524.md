## File transfer

Goal of this exercise is:

- to practice using HackMD
- getting to know your prior knowledge

Below are three tallies, such as this example:

```
What is X?

- [ ] A
- [ ] B
```

Pick one character for you, e.g. `*` or `R` or `?` or whatever (duplicates are fine!). Between the `[ ]` you agree on, write that character. In the end this may look like:

```
What is X?

- [s#k%vq*#6] A
- [q.vR] B
```

Now we know 9 people think A is the answer, where 4 people think it is B.

### 1. My favorite way to transfer files to/from Bianca now is using:

- [xjsr] FileZilla
- [ ] fuse-sshfs and mounting the wharf
- [ ] lftp
- [Z] rsync
- [ ] scp
- [sl] sftp
- [ ] sshfs and mounting the wharf
- [ ] Rclone
- [ ] WinSCP
- [ ] other

### 2. About rsync:

- [ r] I have never followed a lecture on rsync, I don't know what it is
- [sL] I have never heard a lecture on rsync, but I've never gotten it to work
- [j] I have never heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, but don't use it in practice
- [Z] I have never heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, and use it
- [x] I have heard a lecture on rsync, but I've never gotten it to work
- [] I have heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, but don't use it in practice
- [ ] I have heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, and use it

### 3. About FileZilla:

- [ ] I have never followed a lecture on FileZilla, I don't know what it is
- [ ] I have never heard a lecture on FileZilla, but I've never gotten it to work
- [] I have never heard a lecture on FileZilla, I have gotten it to work, but don't use it in practice
- [slj] I have never heard a lecture on FileZilla, I have gotten it to work, and use it
- [r] I have heard a lecture on FileZilla, but I've never gotten it to work
- [ ] I have heard a lecture on FileZilla, I have gotten it to work, but don't use it in practice
- [] I have heard a lecture on FileZilla, I have gotten it to work, and use it
