Each of my lessons has a Gantt chart for the time schedule.

I have prepared well: I checked the course material,
done all the exercises while recording, so I have a YouTube video
of each of my lessons too. I am happy I checked, as
UU's VPN now needs 2FA and I changed to UPPMAX documentation to
reflect this.

I want to try out:

* More time for feedback. I met a colleague in the hallways and stated that
  I had 5 minutes for feedback. She said that was too short. I agreed.
  In hindsight, I am unsure. So I try it out in this course
* Fewer Zoom rooms: I want the learners to remain in the main Zoom room
  and work in silence. Learners can ask questions in the chat or in the shared
  document and if needed, can go to a Zoom room with a TA

Other choices:

* Do tell about myself at the start
* Do ask random learners
* Share with learners to use the videos as a reminder in the future
