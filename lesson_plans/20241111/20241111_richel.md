Most preparation will go to Slurm jobs. I will:
collect/infer Slurm learning objectives from current
basic and intermediate courses.

> Learning objectives Slurm basic:
> 
> - Run simple jobs in the batch system
> - Run interactively on compute nodes
> - See when to run interactive and when to use batch system
> - Check the progress of their jobs

> Learning objectives Slurm intermediate  :
> 
> - Understand what Slurm is
> - Learn to submit jobs to the Slurm queue
> - Learn about the most useful Slurm options and commands
> - Verify the CPU and memory usage of jobs

I will refine this to the following learning objectives
for Slurm intermediate  :
 
- [Remove, I will teach at Apply level] Understand what Slurm is
- [Remove, already done in Basic] Learn to submit jobs to the Slurm queue
- [Need to refine: what is 'useful'?] Learn about the most useful Slurm options and commands
- [Most interesting] Verify the CPU and memory usage of jobs

Resulting in:

- See the CPU and memory usage of jobs
- Know how to set up jobs efficiently
- [Need to refine: what is 'useful'?] Learn about the most useful Slurm options and commands
