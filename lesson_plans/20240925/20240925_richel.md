Each of my lessons has a Gantt chart for the time schedule.

I have prepared well: I checked the course material,
done all the exercises while recording, so I have a YouTube video
of each of my lessons too. I am happy I checked, as
UU's VPN now needs 2FA and I changed to UPPMAX documentation to
reflect this.

I want to keep from previous time:

- Use 10 minutes for feedback
- Do tell about myself at the start
- Do ask random learners
- Share with learners to use the videos as a reminder in the future

I want to change:

- Use Zoom rooms, without changes. Last iteration I kept all learners
  in the main room. This was done, because two iterations back, I changed
  the learners' groups multiple times. This iteration, I'll do the compromise
  between those, as I should have them in little groups.
- [x] prepare the summary by adding other courses
- [ ] create more breakout rooms for the evaluation. Do do
  the evaluation in room 1. Let questions be answered in
  other breakout rooms
- [ ] Add answers to the questions. As we know how important feedback is, it
  is unknown to me why I do not provide the answer: I guess it was
  lack of time?
- [ ] Compare with the Into to UPPMAX Day 1. There, too, I take the time
  for copy-pasting to/from the ThinLinc interface
  - I completely re-use the 'modules' lesson
  - I completely re-use the 'login' lesson
- Indicate two routes: a beginner and an experienced
