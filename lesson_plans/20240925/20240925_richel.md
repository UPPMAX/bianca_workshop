Each of my lessons has a Gantt chart for the time schedule.

I have prepared well: I checked the course material,
done all the exercises while recording, so I have a YouTube video
of each of my lessons too. I am happy I checked, as
UU's VPN now needs 2FA and I changed to UPPMAX documentation to
reflect this.

I want to keep from previous time:

- Use 10 minutes for feedback
- Do tell about myself at the start
- Do ask random learners
- Share with learners to use the videos as a reminder in the future

I want to change:

- Fewer Zoom rooms: I want the learners to remain in the main Zoom room
  and work in silence. Learners can ask questions in the chat or in the shared
  document and if needed, can go to a Zoom room with a TA

- [ ] prepare the summary by adding other courses
- [ ] create more breakout rooms for the evaluation. Do do
  the evaluation in room 1. Let questions be answered in
  other breakout rooms
