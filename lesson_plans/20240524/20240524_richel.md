- Who: `B`: Björn, `L`: Lars, `R`: Richèl

Most of my preparation is in the lessons themselves, 
except I start with the (dull!) 'Who is Richel' lecture.

I searched the literature about how to evaluate online lessons are done well.

Here is a list from [Means, 1993], wording from [Bigatel & Edel-Malizia, 2018]:

- students are engaged in authentic and multidisciplinary tasks
- assessments are based on students’ performance of real tasks
- students participate in interactive modes of instruction
- students work collaboratively
- students are grouped heterogeneously
- the teacher is a facilitator in learning
- students learn through exploration

Here are two assessment tables from [Bigatel & Edel-Malizia, 2018], table 3:

I do have only 65 minutes to teach, 
can and should I try to get all these indicators to pass?
Also, in that one session, I feel it gives more disturbance than usefulness
to mix up the learners again.

Let's go through the items in one big table:

Here is a list from ,

I do have only 65 minutes to teach, 
can and should I try to get all these indicators to pass?
