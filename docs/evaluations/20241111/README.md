# Evaluation Bianca Intermediate

- [results.csv](results.csv)
- [results.ods](results.ods)

## Missing before

From the [prevaluation](../../prevaluations/20241111/README.md):

> Installation of packages on Bianca (without internet connection)

## Missing after

> Perhaps an explanation of Nextflow or snakemake would be useful.
> Since it was a bit difficult to follow if we have not run these workflow
> managers. But I believe it is out of scope!
> Maybe it will be interesting to follow a practical installation
> (demonstration) of Github repo/packages to Bianca.
> Just as it was performed from the file transfers.
> I donÂ´t know if other users will be interested on this,
> but more practical example could be useful.
> Anyhow the course was interesting and
> I learned a lot and feel more confident in working with Bianca.
> Thanks!

## Analysis

These confidences were compared to the
[prevaluation](../../prevaluations/20241111/README.md).
which has most of the same questions.
The analysis code can be found at [analyse.R](analyse.R).
Here are the results:

![All confidences](all_confidences.png)

> All confidences, where blue is the prevaluation
> and red is the post/evaluation. KS is shorthand
> for Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test, a test to determine if two distribitions
> may come from the same underlying distribution, without any assumptions on

> If the p value is low, it can rejected that
> the two distributions come from the same underlying distribution.

Or, in English, these course made a significant difference in confidence.

Now per learning objective:

Or, in English, these sessions made a significant differce:

- I understand how to set up jobs efficiently
- I understand how to install software myself
- I can can run the voted-for IDE on Bianca
