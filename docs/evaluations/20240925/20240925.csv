Great pedagogical methods used by the teachers!"

As many scientists working with sensitive data with use BIanca, also those who are not primarily programmers/data scientists by training, I missed some things: 
Start with an overview: What is the goal with using Bianca (store and work with sensitive data)
For example show a basic statistical analysis in R studio, in graphical interface)
The sensitive data part in the end was too short
Hands-on, how to work with Bianca for users that are not so advanced: For example show a basic statistical analysis in R studio, in graphical interface. 
I missed some info about applying for projects etc

Having cameras on was good but the pinpointing of participants with questions was a bit too much.
