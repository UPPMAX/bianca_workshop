> What did you like the most about the course?

I appreciated the first three hours of the course. They were interactive and appropriately paced with questions, information on how to answer the questions then answers. I appreciated the small group pairings with a mix of experienced and inexperienced users. 

Learning by doing

The hands in for the first part was really an introduction on how to use Bianca for moving files around, to understand purpose of the cluster and the advantages of working with it. So the initial part before lunch seemed quite logical and educational.

File transfer, thinlinc

the online material useful and very extensive

The afternoon sessions were faster paced with less interactive components. If you were new and trying to work along, the session often sped ahead. There was no assistance if you needed help with a particular step as it was a big lecture rather than smaller break out room. 

Some part were just theoretical 

The last QA I thought we were going to have one that could allow attendees to ask questions. I myself had some questions about if Bianca was the best fit for my project as I'm new to it on my recently started job. Also the part with the transfer of files from and to bianca could've had its own hands in and even thought there is a multitude of ways to do this present a couple of them to allow for ways to workaround. Instead this last part was mostly looking at the speaker's computer and seeing what they did. I truly believe the harder part of Bianca is the file transfer feature which is key when deciding wheter is worth it in a project. 

Introduction to linux could be set as a separate/pre course event for non experienced users 

breakout rooms for all the exercises. perhaps have 3 rooms: "advanced", "beginner" "in-between", and then course participants could allocate themselves.

The afternoon sessions all needed more time for the newer users.Perhaps two parallel sessions, one for experienced users and one for new users could have been helpful. 

Software and package installation on Bianca

transfer of files (at least a hands in could've worked well)

more time for transit exercises

There could have been a QA part? More time for own work, followed by QA section for instance. 

Slurm and Software installation

Login to bianca


Introduccion could be summarize by asing around what experience do people have with Uppmax, and reducing the content of the first parts to something more manageable within the first hour.

I thought Richel in particular showed thoughtfulness to how students learn and how to teach with a group of mixed experienced participants. 

Have a Q&A session at the end.

We appreciated how well organised this course was and all the material you set up for us to learn from and go back to in the near future. Thank you!

It was a very helpful course. Thank you!
