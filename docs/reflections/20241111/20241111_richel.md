## Reflection during the day

- [x] [ADDED TO COURSE MATERIAL] Add more arguments for rsync, that differ from FileZilla:
    - can transfer data from everywhere
      to everywhere, especially transfer sensitive data between HPC center
    - (ignore) can transfer (soft) symbolic links


Method   |Can transfer big files?|Can transfer between any HPC center?|Can transfer soft links?|Keeps file attributes?|Can do incremental file transfer?|Can send deletions?
---------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------
`rsync`  |Yes                    |Yes                                 |Yes                     |Yes                   |Yes                              |Yes

scp      |?Yes                   |?Yes                                |?No (P)                 |?                     |?                                |?


- [x] There is something in the documentation with `rsync` where it is
  missing that a command should be run on a local computer
    - [x] Ask Pavlin where exactly
    - Was already correct :-)

I imagined having all learners in the same main Zoom room.
Then I saw Pavlin using breakout rooms.
He was right!
Thanks to him, I started using breakout rooms too. Thanks Pavlin!

Changes to schedule:
- Prevaluation takes 3 minutes to fill in
- Due to the prevaluation, 10 minutes is enough for the full introduction,
  so next session can start 10 minutes earlier
- File transfer can be shortened by 15 mins
- There was too little time for 'Efficient workflow', needs
  15 more minutes
- Installation part 1 can be from 13:00-13:45 (instead of to 13:50).

RStudio took only 15 minutes, as most learners had already done
some

- [ ] Suggest move RStudio to Basic

- 13:57: Hmm, I forgot to properly prepare the summary :-/ , let's do so now :-)
- 15:19 Evaluation started
- 15:20 A learner thanked me and Björn

None of teachers used a shared document.

- [ ] Remove a link to a shared document from the course material

The learners were very enjoyable to work with,
as they were very social. I guess some credit goes to us teachers
for that, but they made it work on the other end of the
conversation.

- Complex and replicate jobs are in parallel sessions,
  suggest to replace IDEs by one of these

## Evaluation results

I think the most interesting is:

Nice improvement, keep it as it is.

A significant positive effect! Keep it as it is!

These was done by 3 out of the 5 learners, which has had
a great impact on the confidences. Keep it as it is!

Great, I did not do that at all :-)

- [ ] Remove this learning objective for next time

These was done by 2 out of the 5 learners. There has been a 3
and 4 for confidence added, so it may have been a good session.

question                                                                         | mean_pre| mean_post|   p_value|different |teacher

A significant positive effect! Keep it as it is.

Judging all this, my findings are:

- I don't care about the prevaluation much: let's not
  bother the learners with it
- Remove the 'I can schedule a simple workflow of jobs that depend on each
  other using Nextflow' learning objective
- I suggest to move RStudio to the Basic Bianca course
- I suggest to remove a link to a shared document from the course material
- If both complex and replicate jobs are important, I suggest to add 30 mins
  to that session, over going parallel
- I suggest a simpler schedule
