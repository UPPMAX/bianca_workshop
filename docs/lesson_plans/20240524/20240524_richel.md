- Who: `B`: Björn, `L`: Lars, `R`: Richèl

Most of my preparation is in the lessons themselves,
except I start with the (dull!) 'Who is Richel' lecture.

I searched the literature about how to evaluate online lessons are done well.

Here is a list from [Means, 1993], wording from [Bigatel & Edel-Malizia, 2018]:

- students are engaged in authentic and multidisciplinary tasks
- assessments are based on students’ performance of real tasks
- students participate in interactive modes of instruction
- students work collaboratively
- students are grouped heterogeneously
- the teacher is a facilitator in learning
- students learn through exploration

Here are two assessment tables from [Bigatel & Edel-Malizia, 2018], table 3:

I do have only 65 minutes to teach,
can and should I try to get all these indicators to pass?
Also, in that one session, I feel it gives more disturbance than usefulness
to mix up the learners again.

Let's go through the items in one big table:

Here is a list from ,

- [3] [Bigatel & Edel-Malizia, 2018], table 2

I do have only 65 minutes to teach (I focus on 'File transfer' here),
can and should I try to get all these indicators to pass?
Also, in that one session, I feel it may give more disturbance than usefulness
to mix up the learners again. Is it worth it?

So, do I do Breakout rooms yes or no?

- Pro: they learn from each other, Feedback is worth it
- Con: disturbance

I do like it to let learners work individually in main room,
but no, Feedback is worth it.

How do I do the Breakout rooms:

- [Fast] automatically assign groups of 2
- [Fast] automatically assign groups of 3, allows 1-1 when 1 learner is gone
- [Fast] automatically assign groups of 4
- [Slow] let learners pick to go to a breakout room
- [Do not: Feedback is effective] allow learners to stay in room during feedback
- [Do: minimizes disturbance] preserve groups after feedback cycle

So:

- automatically assign groups of 3 or more
- call learners back for Feedback
- preserve groups after Feedback

Thursday 13:51 and it is discovered there is something missing from the schedule:
letting the learners login. I should have taken that into consideration earlier!

At the Basic Bianca course, Introduction and login is 60 minutes,
at this Intermediate Bianca course, Introduction is 15 minutes,
with no time for login yet.

I need to update that schedule to make it fit...

Please share your thoughts with us there, thanks!

## File transfer

Goal of this exercise is is to practice using HackMD,
as well as getting to know prior knowledge.

My favorite way to transfer files to/from Bianca now is using:

- [ ] FileZilla
- [ ] fuse-sshfs and mounting the wharf
- [ ] lftp
- [ ] rsync
- [ ] scp
- [ ] sftp
- [ ] sshfs and mounting the wharf
- [ ] Rclone
- [ ] WinSCP
- [ ] other

About rsync:

- [ ] I have never followed a lecture on rsync, I don't know what it is
- [ ] I have never heard a lecture on rsync, but I've never gotten it to work
- [ ] I have never heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, but don't use it in practice
- [ ] I have never heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, and use it
- [ ] I have heard a lecture on rsync, but I've never gotten it to work
- [ ] I have heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, but don't use it in practice
- [ ] I have heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, and use it

About FileZilla:

- [ ] I have never followed a lecture on FileZilla, I don't know what it is
- [ ] I have never heard a lecture on FileZilla, but I've never gotten it to work
- [ ] I have never heard a lecture on FileZilla, I have gotten it to work, but don't use it in practice
- [ ] I have never heard a lecture on FileZilla, I have gotten it to work, and use it
- [ ] I have heard a lecture on FileZilla, but I've never gotten it to work
- [ ] I have heard a lecture on FileZilla, I have gotten it to work, but don't use it in practice

## Evaluation

If you leave early, an evaluation can be found at <https://forms.gle/TpYYr6EhdgUQdPwn7>. Please share your thoughts with us there, thanks!

## File transfer

Goal of this exercise is:

- to practice using HackMD
- getting to know your prior knowledge

Below are three tallies, such as this example:

```text
What is X?

- [ ] A
- [ ] B
```

Pick one character for you, e.g. `*` or `R` or `?` or whatever (duplicates are fine!). Between the `[ ]` you agree on, write that character. In the end this may look like:

```text
What is X?

- [s#k%vq*#6] A
- [q.vR] B
```

Now we know 9 people think A is the answer, where 4 people think it is B.
