# Indicators of engagement

Here is the first of two assessment tables, adapted from [Bigatel & Edel-Malizia, 2018]:

Feature                         | CI | SEE | BE | Part of feature                 | Good instructional approach
--------------------------------|----|-----|----|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vision of Learning**          |.   |Y    |Y   | **Responsible for learning**    | Learner involved in setting goals, choosing tasks, developing assessments and standards for the tasks; has big picture of learning and next steps in mind
**Vision of Learning**          |Y   |.    |.   | **Strategic**                   | Learner actively develops repertoire of thinking/learning strategies for changeable and complex knowledge building
**Vision of Learning**          |.   |Y    |Y   | **Energized by learning**       | Learning is intrinsic; has a passion for learning, solving problems
**Vision of Learning**          |.   |Y    |.   | **Collaborative**               | Learner develops new ideas and understanding in conversations and work with others
**Technology**                  |.   |Y    |Y   | **Interconnectivity**           | Technology allows interaction by communicating and collaborating in diverse ways
**Technology**                  |Y   |.    |.   | **Access to challenging tasks** | Technology offers or allows access to tasks, data, and learning opportunities that stimulate thought and inquiry
**Technology**                  |.   |Y    |.   | **Enables learning by doing**   | Technology offers access to simulations, goals-based learning, and real-world problems and productivity tools

- `CI` = Cognitive investment, i.e. being thoughtful
- `SEE` = Socio-emotional engagement, i.e. interactions and/or reactions
- `BE` = Behavioral engagement, i.e. participation
