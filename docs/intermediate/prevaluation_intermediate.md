# Prevaluation

A prevaluation is an evaluation done before the course has started.

Goals of the prevaluation are:

- For the learners: to get an introduction of what will be taught
- For the teachers: to measure how much knowledge is gained

The prevaluation form can be found `TODO`.

???- question "What do you mean with 'to measure how much knowledge is gained'?

    Here is [part of an evaluation](https://github.com/UPPMAX/bianca_workshop/blob/main/reflections/20240925/20240925_richel.md):

    All learners stated 'I can absolutely do this!' for
    'I can log in to Bianca using the remote desktop'.
    Us teachers did a good job there!

    Did we? That depends on how much the learners already knew. Maybe
    everyone already knew how to do this.

    If all learners already knew about this, we could
    consider removing this. 

    If all learners did not knew about this, then, indeed,
    us teachers did a good job :-)

???- question "What are the prevaluation questions?"

    These are the same as the evaluation questions,
    except for an additional question:

    Is there a learning objective you think is missing? What is it?
