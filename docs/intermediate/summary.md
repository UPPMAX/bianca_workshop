# Summary

I can transfer files to/from Bianca using `rsync`

```bash
ssh sven@transit.uppmax.uu.se
mount_wharf sens2023598
rsync my_local_file.txt sven@transit.uppmax.uu.se:sens2023598
rsync --recursive my_folder sven@transit.uppmax.uu.se:sens2023598
```

I can see the CPU and memory usage of jobs

```bash
jobstats --plot 1234567
```

I understand how to set up jobs efficiently

- Enough cores for memory
- CPU limited? Consider adding more until CPU usage is around 80% on average
- Consider addigng 1 core for safety

I can schedule a simple workflow of jobs that depend on each other using Slurm

```bash
sbatch --A sens2023598 --dependency=afterok:5000000,5000001 do_c.sh
```

I can schedule a simple workflow of jobs that depend on each other using Nextflow

```bash
#SBATCH --array=0-10
