## The module system

???- tip "Forgot how to use the module system?"

    See [the basic Bianca course page 'Using the module system'](../modules.md).

- **Lots of programs and tools installed as modules** on Bianca.
    - You can **request installations** but that **may take several days or weeks** to be handled by the application experts at UPPMAX.
    - Workflow: Application expert installs on Rackham and it is synced over to Bianca within a day.
- **Installations yourself**.
    - Workflow: use the **``wharf`` to transfer installation files and packages to Bianca from Rackham or other place**. Here the use of Rackham comes handy because
        - of the internet connection.
        - the computer architecture is somewhat similar such that precompiled binaries or compiled programs (x86_64) on Rackham will most often work also on Bianca.

## Install software yourself

- If not available on Bianca already (like Conda repositories) --> use the ``wharf`` to install your tools

!!! note "Typical workflow for installation"

    - **Download** the
        - _source_ code or
        - _binary_ (Linux on x86 and 64-bit)
    - **Transfer** to the ``wharf``
    - Move file(s) to either
        - ``$HOME`` directory.
            - Handy for personal needs and low numbers of files â€” i.e. not Conda.
            - Example python/R/julia packages.
        - Usually better to install in project directory.
            - This way the project contains both data and software
            - Good for reproducibility, collaboration, and everyone's general sanity.
    - Then, either:
        - Binaries for Linux on x86 and 64-bit should be able to be run directly as they are.
        - Install program following instructions from documentation of the software.

### Build from source (C/C++ and Fortran)

- To build from source use a **compiler module**
- We have several compiler versions from GNU and INTEL
- ``make`` is installed on the system
    - :warning: It could happen that the "Makefile" contains web fetching, which will not work from Bianca.
    - Usually it is not a problem to build on Rackham and move to Bianca.
- ``cmake`` is available as module

### Containers

- Containers let you install programs without needing to think about the computer environment, like
    - operative system
    - dependencies (libraries and other programs) with correct versions

!!! info

    - 2(3) types
    
        1. Singularity/Apptainer perfect for HPC systems
        2. Docker that does not work on HPC-systems
        
            - But docker images can be used by Singularity and Apptainer
            
    - Everything is included
    - Workflow:
    
        - Download on Rackham or local computer
        - Transfer to Bianca
        - Move to from wharf to any place in your working folders on Bianca
        
    - Draw-backs
    
        - you install also things that may be already installed
        - therefore, probably more disk space is needed

## Packages and libraries to scripting programs

- Python, R and Julia all have some **centrally installed packages** that are available from the modules.
- R has a special module called ``R_packages``, and some Machine Learning python packages are included in the ``python_ml_packages`` module.
- If not found there you can try to install those by yourself.


### Check packages

!!! admonition "R"

    ``$ ml R_packages/4.3.1``

    Then within R, try loading the package you want, like ``glmnet``:

    ``library(glmnet)``

!!! admonition "Python"

    - Check **python versions**: ``ml avail python``
    - Check **python packages/modules**

        1. **help** output from: ``ml help python/3.12.7``
        2. In a loaded python

            - **Load** a python version, like: ``ml python/3.11.8``
            - from **Python shell** with the ``import`` command
            - from **BASH shell** with the ``pip list`` command

!!! admonition "Julia"

    - At UPPMAX there is a central library with installed packages.
    - This is good, especially when working on Bianca, since you then do not need to install via the ``wharf``.
    - It is often better to install you own, see below, or ask the support to install centrally.

    - Check **julia versions**: ``ml avail julia``
    - Check **julia packages/modules**

        1. **help** output from: ``ml help julia/1.9.3``
        2. In a loaded julia

            - **Load** a python version, like: ``ml julia/1.8.5``
            - from **julia shell** with the ``using`` command

### Install packages, principles

!!! info "Installation principle"

    - Install on Rackham or other place
    - Sync to ``wharf``
    - Move the files on Bianca to a place in the path used for packages of R, Python (pip) or julia

!!! admonition "R links"

    - Typical place to put R packages: ``~/R`` 
    - Otherwise you may have to update your ``R_LIBS_USER="<path>"``
    
    **Links**

!!! admonition "pip links"

    - Typical place to put python packages: ``~/.local/lib/python<version>/site-packages/`` 
    - Otherwise you may have to update ``PYTHONPATH="<path>"``

!!! info "Tip Python packages"

    - Try Conda first directly on Bianca. We have mirrored all _major_ Conda repositories directly on UPPMAX, on both Rackham and Bianca. These are updated every third day.
    - If you want to keep number of files down, use PyPI (pip), but then you need to use Rackham and the ``wharf``.

!!! admonition "Conda"

    - We have mirrored the non-proprietary Conda repositories (not ``main``, ``anaconda`` and ``r``) directly on UPPMAX, on both Rackham and Bianca. These are updated every third day.

    - [Conda user guide](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/conda/)

!!! admonition "Julia"

    - Typical place to put julia packages: ``~/.julia/packages`` 
    - Otherwise you may have to update ``export JULIA_LOAD_PATH="path1:path2:..."``

## Own development and Git

- [Own development and git](https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshop/extra/devel/)

!!! abstract "Keypoints"

    - You have got an overview of the procedures to install packages/libraries and tools on Bianca through the ``wharf``
    - If you feel uncomfortable or think that many users would benefit from the software, ask the support to install it.
