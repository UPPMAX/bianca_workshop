## Introduction

RStudio is an IDE specialized for the R programming language.

???- tip "What is an IDE?"

    See [the page on IDEs](ides.md).

In this session, we show how to use RStudio on Bianca,
using Bianca's remote desktop environment.

As RStudio is a resource-heavy program,
it must be run on an interactive node.

    See [the basic Bianca course page 'Starting an interactive node'](../start_interactive_node.md).
