???- question "Exercise: Start RStudio"

    The goal of this exercise is to make sure you can start
    RStudio.

    How to start RStudio is in the instructions above
    and in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/rRUb4pqaVak).

???- question "How to find out if you are on a login or interactive node"

    In the terminal, type `hostname`

    - the login node has `[project]-bianca`, where `[project]` is the name of the project, e.g. `sens2023598`
    - the interactive node has `b[number]` in it, where `[number]` is the compute node number
