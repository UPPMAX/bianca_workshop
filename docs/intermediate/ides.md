## Introduction

IDE (pronounce `aj-dee-ee`) is short for 'Integrated Development Environment',
or 'a program in which you do programming'.
The goal of an IDE is to help develop code, with features
such as code completion, code hints and interactive debugging.

There are [many different IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments)), 
of which some are tailored to one programming
language (e.g. RStudio) and some allow multiple programming languages.

In this session, we show how to use the most popular IDEs on Bianca.

In all cases, we login to the Bianca remote desktop environment.
