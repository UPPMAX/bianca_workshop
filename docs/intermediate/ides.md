## Introduction

IDE (pronounce 'aj-dee-ee') is short for 'Integrated Development Environment',
or 'a program in which you do programming'.

There are [many different IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments)), 
of which some are tailored to one programming
language (e.g. RStudio) and some allow multiple programming languages.
