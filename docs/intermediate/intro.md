# Bianca In-Depth Hackathon: Improve Your Handling of Sensitive Research Data

Are you already working with sensitive data in your research 
and feel your workflow can be improved? 
If yes, welcome to a full day of learning of smarter ways 
to work on the Bianca UPPMAX cluster. 

???- tip "I am new to Bianca, where do I start?"

    As a beginner, you are encouraged to start with the
    basic Bianca course, at [here](../intro.md).

You will learn how to login from a terminal (bypassing ThinLinc), 
do file transfer from a terminal (allowing scripts), 
advanced SLURM, using IDEs (i.e. RStudio and/or VSCode), 
and installing custom software and packages.
