# Bianca In-Depth Hackathon: Improve Your Handling of Sensitive Research Data

Are you already working with sensitive data in your research and feel your workflow can be improved? If yes, welcome to a full day of learning of smarter ways to work on the Bianca UPPMAX cluster. We will tell you how to login from a terminal (bypassing ThinLinc), do file transfer from a terminal (allowing scripts), advanced SLURM, using IDEs (i.e. RStudio and/or VSCode), and installing custom software and packages.
