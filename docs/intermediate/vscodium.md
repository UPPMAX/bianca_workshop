## Introduction

VSCodium is the community edition of Visual Studio Code
and can be used for software development in many languages.

???- tip "What is an IDE?"

    See [the page on IDEs](ides.md).

In this session, we show how to use VSCodium on Bianca,
using Bianca's remote desktop environment.

???- tip "Forgot how to login to a remote desktop environment?"

    See [the basic Bianca course page 'Logging in'](../login_bianca.md).

As VSCodium is a resource-heavy program,
it must be run on an interactive node.

???- tip "Forgot how to start an interactive node?"

    See [the basic Bianca course page 'Starting an interactive node'](../start_interactive_node.md).
