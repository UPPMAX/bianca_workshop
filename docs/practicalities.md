!!! info "Suggestion for window layout"

    If you have just one screen (e.g. a laptop), we recommend arranging your windows like this:

    ```c
    ╔═══════════╗ ╔═════════════╗
    ║   WEB     ║ ║  TERMINAL   ║
    ║  BROWSER  ║ ║   WINDOW    ║
    ║  WINDOW   ║ ╚═════════════╝
    ║   WITH    ║ ╔═════════════╗
    ║   THE     ║ ║   BROWSER   ║
    ║  STREAM   ║ ║   W/HACKMD  ║
    ╚═══════════╝ ╚═════════════╝
    ```
