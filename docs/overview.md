## The bigger picture

Here we place UPPMAX within the bigger, national, picture,
starting from the biggest source of money for research in Sweden.

![Vetenskapsrådet logo](./img/vr_logo_128_x_154.png)

[Vetenskapsrådet](https://www.vr.se) ('Science counsel', VR) is biggest funder
of research in Sweden and funds the national HPC infrastructure. 

![NAISS logo](./img/naiss_logo_416_x_68.png)

The [National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden](https://www.naiss.se/) (NAISS) provides such HPC infrastructure: computing power, storage and data services. Applications for these resources starts at
[this NAISS page](https://www.naiss.se//#application-rounds-for-compute-and-storage-resources). These resources are physically located in multiple places in Sweden,
among other Uppsala.

![UPPMAX logo](./img/uppmax_logo.png)

[Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/) (**UPPMAX = UppMACS**) 
provides the HPC infrastructure that is physically located in Uppsala. 
Part of this is to provide training and [support](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support).

## UPPMAX systems

Here we place Bianca between the other UPPMAX systems.

There are three types of UPPMAX systems:

- Computing systems
- Storage systems
- Cloud services

### UPPMAX computing systems

Computing systems allow a user to do heavier computational calculations.

[UPPMAX has, among others, the following clusters](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/resources/systems/):

- Rackham: regular data, general purpose
- Snowy: regular data, long runs and GPU:s
- **Bianca: for sensitive data, general use**
- Miarka: for sensitive data, SciLifeLab-only

A technical summary can be found below.

```

### UPPMAX storage systems

Storage systems allow a user to storage (big amounts of) data,
for either active use (i.e. in calculations) or to archive it.
Storage for active use is also called 'on-load' storage,
where archived data is called 'off-load' storage.

The [UPPMAX storage systems](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/resources/systems/storage-systems/) are:
- On-load: Castor for Bianca, Crex for Rackham
- Off-load: Lutra for Rackham

```

### UPPMAX Cloud services

Cloud services allow a user to have something active (typically a website)
that can be accessed by the internet.

For this, the [UPPMAX cloud](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/resources/systems/the-uppmax-cloud/)
has a service called 'Dis' (the Swedish word for 'haze') and is part of
the `EAST-1` region of the SNIC science cloud. 

## Bianca

Here we describe what Bianca is, 
where her name comes from,
and the ideas behind her design.

### Bianca's name

Bianca, like all clusters at UPPMAX, 
is named after a Tintin character,
in this case after Bianca Castafiore.

![Bianca Castafiore, from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bianca_Castafiore-Tintin_comics_series.png](./img/bianca_castafiore_192_x_226.png)

### Bianca's design

Bianca is an high-performance computing cluster for sensitive data.

Or: Bianca is a group of computers that can effectively run many calculations, 
as requested by multiple people, at the same time.
As the data is sensitive, it is protected to remain only on Bianca.

Bianca is designed to

- Protect the sensitive data: 
    - (1a) Accidental data leaks should be difficult
    - (1b) Law: if data is leaked, the person doing so should be possibly identified
- Emulate a standard HPC cluster environment:
    - (2a) Use the hardware as efficient as possible
    - (2b) Distributes shared resources (CPU, memory) in a fair way
    - (2c) make correct data management as easy as possible

### Difference between supercomputer and (high-performing) computer cluster

![A supercomputer, from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IBM_Blue_Gene_P_supercomputer.jpg](./img/IBM_Blue_Gene_P_supercomputer_422_x_280.jpg)

A supercomputer is a machine that is optimized for doing calculations
quickly. For example, to predict the weather for tomorrow, the calculation
may not take a week. The image above is a supercomputer.

![A computer cluster using some Raspberry Pi's](./img/small_cluster_307_x_230.jpg)

A computer cluster is a machine that is optimized for doing a lot of calculations.
The image above shows a home-made computer cluster.
This home-made computer cluster may not be suitable for high-performance.

![The Rackham computer cluster](./img/uppmax-light2_412_x_285.jpg)

The image above shows Rackham, another UPPMAX 
computer cluster, suitable for high-performance computing.
This makes Rackham an high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.
Bianca and Rackham are HPC clusters.

### Restrictions on a computer cluster

A computer cluster is a group of computers that can run
many calculations, as requested by multiple people, at the same time.

To ensure fair use of this shared resource, regular users
are restricted in some ways:

- Users cannot run calculations directly. 
  Instead, users need to request either (1) a calculation to be run,
  or (2) an interactive node

???- tip "Requesting a calculation to run"

    Requesting a calculation to run is part of this course 
    and is described [here](slurm-intro.md).
    This is done by using the SLURM scheduler.

???- tip "Requesting an interactive node"

    Requesting an interactive node is part of this course 
    and is described [here](login_bianca.md).
    This is done by requesting an interactive node 
    from the SLURM scheduler.


- Users cannot install software directly. 
  Instead, users need to use pre-installed software or learn
  techniques how to run custom software anyway

???- tip "Using pre-installed software"

    Using pre-installed software is part of this course 
    and is described [here](modules1.md).
    This is done by using the module system.

???- tip "How to run custom software"

    Techniques how to run custom software is *not* part of this course.
    Instead, one technique is part of the intermediate Bianca course 
    and can be found described [here](extra/containers/),
    which is about using containers

These restrictions apply to most general-purpose clusters. 
However, Bianca is a **sensitive data** cluster, to which
more restrictions apply.

### Restrictions on a sensitive data computer cluster

Next to the general restrictions above, 
Bianca also is a **sensitive data** cluster.
This sensitive data must be protected to remain only on Bianca,
due to which there are these additional restrictions to users:

- Users have no direct access to internet.
  Instead, users can up/download files from/to a special folder.

???- tip "File transfer"

    Transferring file is part of this course and is described [here](transfer_basic.md).
    This is done using

The goal is *not* to prevent the up/download of sensitive data,
instead it is to prevent the *accidental* up/download of sensitive data.
As these up/downloads are monitored, in case of an accident, 
the extent of the leak and the person (accidentally) causing it
is known. Identifying a responsible person in case of such an
accident is required by law.

## What is a computer cluster technically?

A computer cluster is a machine that consists out of many computers.
These computers work together.

Each computer of a cluster is called a **node**.

There are three types of nodes:

- **login nodes**: nodes where a user enters and interacts with the system
- **calculation nodes**: nodes that do the calculations
- **interactive nodes**: a type of calculation node, where a user can do calculations directly

Each node contains several CPU/GPU cores, RAM and local storage space.

A user logs in to a login node via the Internet.

???- tip "Logging in"

    Logging in is part of this course and is described [here](login_bianca.md).

???- tip "Requesting an interactive node"

    Requesting an interactive node is part of this course 
    and is described [here](login_bianca.md).
    This is done by requesting an interactive node 
    from the SLURM scheduler.

## Questions

???- question "Your want to request access to general-purpose HPC. At which website does your journey start?"

    Either a search engine to google for 'NAISS', or directly [https://naiss.se](https://naiss.se)

???- question "Your colleague visits [http://bianca.uppmax.uu.se/](http://bianca.uppmax.uu.se/) and sees nothing appear. What is likely the problem?"

    He/she is not inside of SUNET.

???- question "You want to use a piece of software that came out this morning (!) on Bianca. Will you be able to? Why?"

    This will likely fail, as it is not a pre-installed piece of software.
    
    If you are more advanced, there are ways to get it running yourself.

???- question "You want to use an online tool to do a calculation on Bianca. Will this work? Why?"

    This will fail, because Bianca has (close to) no internet access.

???- question "You find out you can run scripts with calculations directly on the login node. This saves him/her much time waiting for a calculation to start. Is this OK and why?"

    For you, there seems to be no problem. 
    However, for everyone else this is a problem,
    as the login node is a *shared* node.

    You will be asked to *schedule* your jobs instead. 

???- question "You are developing code on Bianca. You write the code line-by-line and schedule a test run after each addition. However, after each new line, it takes a couple of minutes before you know your code worked yes/no. How could you develop your code quicker?"

    This is the typical use-case to use an interactive node.
    One could also consider to develop code on a local computer 
    instead (which uses nonsensitive/simulated/fake testing data)
    and upload the final code instead.

???- question "Your script downloads a human reference genome from a secure website. Will this work on Bianca? Why?"

    This will fail, because Bianca has (close to) no internet access.

???- question "You have a problem on Bianca that is too hard to solve. Where do you ask us for help?"
