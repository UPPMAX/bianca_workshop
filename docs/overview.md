# Overview

!!! info "Objectives"
    - We'll get an overview of UPPMAX and SNIC/NAISS and how a computer cluster works


**UPPMAX = UppMACS**
- [Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science](http://uppmax.uu.se)

## NAISS
- [**National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden**](https://www.naiss.se/)
- Mission: to provide a quality high-performance computing environment nationally

- Starting 1 January 2023, the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS) is the new organization for high-performance computing, storage, and date services for academic users in Sweden. 
- From the users perspective, there will initially only be minimal differences between the SNIC and NAISS regimes.
    - FAQ:s — <https://www.naiss.se/>
- Application rounds: <https://www.naiss.se//#application-rounds-for-compute-and-storage-resources>
- NAISS and Uppsala University fund UPPMAX — UU’s supercomputing center.


## UPPMAX missions
- Runs the clusters placed in Uppsala.
- More details in the afternoon about Organisational orienteering!

    
## UPPMAX systems

- Clusters
    - Rackham (general purpose)
        - Snowy (Long runs and GPU:s)
    - **Bianca (sensitive data)**
        - Miarka (new for LifeScience)
- Storage
    - On-load directly connected to the clusters
    - Off-load for large data not needed for computation analysis anymore
- Cloud
    - Dis (region EAST-1)

## High Performance Computing — HPC
### What is a cluster?

- A network of computers, each computer working as a **node**.

- From small scale RaspberryPi cluster... 
     
![RaspBerry](./img/IMG_5111.jpeg)

- To supercomputers like Rackham.

![Rackham](./img/uppmax-light2.jpg)

- Each node contains several processor cores and RAM and a local disk called scratch.

![Node](./img/node.png)

- The user logs in to **login nodes**  via Internet through ssh or Thinlinc.

  - Here the file management and lighter data analysis can be performed.

- The **calculation nodes** have to be used for intense computing.

!!! abstract "keypoints"
    - NAISS makes available large-scale high-performance computing resources, storage capacity, and advanced user support, for Swedish research. 
    - UPPMAX runs the local resources placed at Uppsala Universty
    - A cluster consists of several inter-connected computers that can work individually or together.
