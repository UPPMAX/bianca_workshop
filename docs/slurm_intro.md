    - The learners should be able to:
        - Run simple jobs in the batch system
        - Run interactively on compute nodes
        - When interactive and when batch
    -     Check your jobs


???- info "Notes for teachers"

    - The learners demonstrate to have run in interactive 
    - The learners demonstrate to have run batch job
