- [ ] Add more arguments for rsync, that differ from FileZilla: 
    - can transfer data from everywhere
      to everywhere, especially transfer sensitive data between HPC center
    - can transfer (soft) symbolic links

Method   |Can transfer big files?|Can transfer between any HPC center?|Can transfer soft links?|Keeps file attributes?|Can do incremental file transfer?|Can send deletions?

- [x] There is something in the documentation with `rsync` where it is
  missing that a command should be run on a local computer
    - [x] Ask Pavlin where exactly
    - Was already correct :-)

I imagined having all learners in the same main Zoom room.
Then I saw Pavlin using breakout rooms.
He was right!
Thanks to him, I started using breakout rooms too. Thanks Pavlin!

Changes to schedule:
- Prevaluation takes 3 minutes to fill in
- Due to the prevaluation, 10 minutes is enough for the full introduction,
  so next session can start 10 minutes earlier
- File transfer can be shortened by 15 mins
- There was too little time for 'Efficient workflow', needs
  15 more minutes
