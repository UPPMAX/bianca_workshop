## Reflection during the day

- [x] [ADDED TO COURSE MATERIAL] Add more arguments for rsync, that differ from FileZilla: 
    - can transfer data from everywhere
      to everywhere, especially transfer sensitive data between HPC center
    - (ignore) can transfer (soft) symbolic links
    

Method   |Can transfer big files?|Can transfer between any HPC center?|Can transfer soft links?|Keeps file attributes?|Can do incremental file transfer?|Can send deletions?
---------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------
`rsync`  |Yes                    |Yes                                 |Yes                     |Yes                   |Yes                              |Yes

- [x] There is something in the documentation with `rsync` where it is
  missing that a command should be run on a local computer
    - [x] Ask Pavlin where exactly
    - Was already correct :-)

I imagined having all learners in the same main Zoom room.
Then I saw Pavlin using breakout rooms.
He was right!
Thanks to him, I started using breakout rooms too. Thanks Pavlin!

Changes to schedule:
- Prevaluation takes 3 minutes to fill in
- Due to the prevaluation, 10 minutes is enough for the full introduction,
  so next session can start 10 minutes earlier
- File transfer can be shortened by 15 mins
- There was too little time for 'Efficient workflow', needs
  15 more minutes
- Installation part 1 can be from 13:00-13:45 (instead of to 13:50).

RStudio took only 15 minutes, as most learners had already done
some

- [ ] Suggest move RStudio to Basic

- 13:57: Hmm, I forgot to properly prepare the summary :-/ , let's do so now :-)
- 15:19 Evaluation started
- 15:20 A learner thanked me and Björn

The learners were very enjoyable to work with,
as they were very social. I guess some credit goes to us teachers
for that, but they made it work on the other end of the
conversation.

- Complex and replicate jobs are in parallel sessions,
  suggest to replace IDEs by one of these
