# Reflection Richel

## Until afternoon

I taught these sessions, according to the lesson plan I made:

When  | Who  | What
------|------|-----------------------------
9:00  | R    | Introduction and logging in
10:00 | .    | Break
10:15 | R    | Command line
11:00 | .    | Break
11:15 | R    | Modules
12:00 | .    | Lunch

I general, I am quite happy with the results.
This is also thanks to the learners that kept their
camera on and were sharing openly and volunteered
for the harder demonstrations!

One learner put in the chat:

> Super nice dynamics RichÃ©l! Thanks ðŸ‘Œ

Where I replied:

> Thanks you for being an awesome learner! Great to see a volunteer for those things!
> P.S. if you'd share that feedback in the shared document (or the anonymous evaluation at the end, you can indirectly encourage my colleagues to do the same :-)

To which I got the reply:

> OF COURSE! Count with that =)

Again, such is an awesome learner to have around!

This was what I want to try out:

- More time for feedback. I met a colleague in the hallways and stated that
  I had 5 minutes for feedback. She said that was too short. I agreed.
  In hindsight, I am unsure. So I try it out in this course

I think 10 minutes feedback is a nice duration: 
it is just long enough and we finished on time give or take a few seconds.
Maybe 5 more minutes would be even better, to go into a bit more detail,
but now seems to fit good enough

- Fewer Zoom rooms: I want the learners to remain in the main Zoom room
  and work in silence. Learners can ask questions in the chat or in the shared
  document and if needed, can go to a Zoom room with a TA

I think this worked out nicely!
My colleagues helped out beautifully on the shared document
and/or talking in a breakout room.

Other choices:

- Do tell about myself at the start

Felt OK, even though I still do not like it.

- Do ask random learners

Felt OK. I again shared why I do this and I think I created
a nice atmosphere in which it was OK to be wrong.

- Share with learners to use the videos as a reminder in the future

Felt OK. Judging from the changing facial expression in some learners' camera's, 
I do think they used the documentation; it did not look passive at all :-)

Rounding up for now: I think this is a effective setup for learning.
