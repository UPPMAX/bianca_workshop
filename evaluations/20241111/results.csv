But I believe it is out of scope! Maybe it will be interesting to follow a practical installation (demonstration) of Github repo/packages to Bianca. Just as it was performed from the file transfers. I donÂ´t know if other users will be interested on this, but more practical example could be useful. Anyhow the course was interesting and I learned a lot and feel more confident in working with Bianca. Thanks! "
