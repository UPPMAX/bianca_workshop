## Evaluation

This is an anonymous evaluation
and will ideally be published in raw form at 
https://github.com/UPPMAX/bianca_workshop/tree/main/evaluations/20240524 .
To do so, please do not share sensitive data here!

This evaluation uses a shared document. 
The drawback is that one needs to be careful when multiple people
are editing at the same time, which may result in some data loss.
The advantages that outweights this
are that there is no owner of this data (i.e. all learners and teachers
have access) and it guarantees a literal archivation of
the data (i.e. a copy-paste).

### 1. Did the course achieve its goals?

Share your confidence on having learned the topics discussed today,
by going thought the list on the shared document.

Although it will be messy, between `[ ]`, add a number for confidence:

Grade|Description
-----|------------------------------------
`0`  |I have no idea what this is about
`1`  |I have no confidence I can do this
`2`  |I have low confidence I can do this
`3`  |I have some confidence I can do this
`4`  |I have good confidence I can do this
`5`  |I absolutely can do this!

This may result in a measurement like this:

- `[00101000111201]`: half of the learners have no idea what this was about 
- `[22111112111231]`: most learners have low confidence
- `[44345454545454]`: most learners have high confidence
