Below are the question. If needed, specify your ideas per session.

### What should we keep doing? 

- keep ther overall structure and input
- ...
- Good interactive sessions, especially in the morning. Maybe more interactive in the afternoon
- ...
- Very interactive and enjoyable course structure, logical flow of topics.
- Great with several teachers/helpers in the sessions to give individual help when needed
- Good with exercises so we get to try what we learn
- ...
- Good interactive sessions
- ...
- teacher/helper to student ration was really good
- ...
- ...
- Amazing dynamics to keep everyone on the same page. Other bioinfo workshops I have attended tend to be less "interactive" hence more difficult. Thanks!

### Which section(s) scheduled enough time for exercises?

- The morning had too much time, while the others had too little time
- ...
- A bit too much time in the morning perhaps, maybe some more time could be put into the afternoon to be able to actually try the file transfer for example.
- could be less time for basic scripting and bash exercises and more time for file transfer and job sceduling. We had the sample data, but never did not have time to properly go through it, besides reviewing the example script.
- The morning session had enough time (perhaps optional extra exercises for the fast students)
- Logging in from Rackham to Bianca is unclear a bit! 
- ...
- It would have been good to spend more time on the second part, maybe to actually try a data transfer + use that data in a job scheduler
- ...

### What should we improve?

- more time for file transfer and exercises in that section
- agree with the comment above
- Maybe have some session about how to apply for an account, it is really hard to do if you've never worked on any cluster before ie estimations on compute space needed and nodes etc.
- More time for the sessions with Bj√∂rn and Pavlin in the afternoon
- The afternoon sessions were too quick for a beginner in coding. Jargon, terminology, quickly using commands that I was unfamiliar with made me get lost pretty quickly.
- Perhaps more info on developing a script, what way can you scale up your project and estimate workload or test running time.
- ...
- Don't have a feedback/evaluation document where text can (accidentaly) be deleted and edited by others :)
- Perhaps to extend more time for the practical exercises. And go throught them together in some of the cases.
