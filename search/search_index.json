So the initial part before lunch seemed quite logical and educational.\n\nFile transfer, thinlinc\n\nthe online material useful and very extensive\n</code></pre> <p>What did you like the least about the course?</p> <pre><code>The afternoon sessions were faster paced with less interactive components. If you were new and trying to work along, the session often sped ahead. There was no assistance if you needed help with a particular step as it was a big lecture rather than smaller break out room.\n\nSome part were just theoretical\n\nThe last QA I thought we were going to have one that could allow attendees to ask questions. I myself had some questions about if Bianca was the best fit for my project as I'm new to it on my recently started job. Also the part with the transfer of files from and to bianca could've had its own hands in and even thought there is a multitude of ways to do this present a couple of them to allow for ways to workaround. Instead this last part was mostly looking at the speaker's computer and seeing what they did. I truly believe the harder part of Bianca is the file transfer feature which is key when deciding wheter is worth it in a project.\n\nIntroduction to linux could be set as a separate/pre course event for non experienced users\n\nbreakout rooms for all the exercises. perhaps have 3 rooms: \"advanced\", \"beginner\" \"in-between\", and then course participants could allocate themselves.\n</code></pre> <p>Which sessions should have had more dedicated time?</p> <pre><code>The afternoon sessions all needed more time for the newer users.Perhaps two parallel sessions, one for experienced users and one for new users could have been helpful.\n\nSoftware and package installation on Bianca\n\ntransfer of files (at least a hands in could've worked well)\n\nmore time for transit exercises\n\nThere could have been a QA part?

This saves him/her much time waiting for a calculation to start. Is this OK and why? <p>For that colleague, there seems to be no problem. However, for everyone else this is a problem, as the login node is a shared node.</p> <p>The colleague will be asked to schedule his/her jobs instead. This is usually done by an email from the UPPMAX staff.</p> <p>Requesting a calculation to run is part of this course. This is done by using the SLURM scheduler.</p> 6. You are developing code on Bianca. You write the code line-by-line and schedule a test run after each addition. However, after each new line, it takes a couple of minutes before you know your code worked yes/no. How could you develop your code quicker? <p>This is the typical use-case to use an interactive node. One could also consider to develop code on a local computer instead (which uses nonsensitive/simulated/fake testing data) and upload the final code instead.</p> <p>Requesting an interactive node is part of this course. This is done by requesting an interactive node from the SLURM scheduler.</p> 7. Your script downloads a human reference genome from a secure website. Will this work on Bianca? Why? <p>This will fail, because Bianca has (close to) no internet access.</p> 8. You have a problem on Bianca that is too hard to solve. Where do you ask us for help? <p>Google for 'UPPMAX support' or directly go to https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support.</p>","tags":["lesson","session"]},{"location":"intermediate/overview/#extra-material","title":"Extra material","text":"","tags":["lesson","session"]},{"location":"intermediate/overview/#uppmax-clusters-technical-summary","title":"UPPMAX clusters technical summary","text":"Rackham Snowy Bianca Purpose General-purpose General-purpose Sensitive # Intel CPU Nodes 486+144 228 288 # GPU Nodes - 50, Nvidia T4 10, 2x Nvidia A100 each Cores per node 20/16 16 16/64 Memory per node 128 GB 128 GB 128 GB Fat nodes 256 GB &amp; 1 TB 256, 512 GB &amp; 4 TB 256 &amp; 512 GB Local disk (scratch) 2/3 TB 4 TB 4 TB Login nodes Yes No (reached from Rackham) Yes (2 cores and 15 GB) \"Home\" storage Domus Domus Castor \"Project\" Storage Crex, Lutra Crex, Lutra Castor","tags":["lesson","session"]},{"location":"intermediate/overview/#detailed-overview-of-the-uppmax-systems","title":"Detailed overview of the UPPMAX systems","text":"<pre><code>\n  graph TB\n\n  Node1 -- interactive --&gt; SubGraph2Flow\n  Node1 -- sbatch --&gt; SubGraph2Flow\n  subgraph \"Snowy\"\n  SubGraph2Flow(calculation nodes)\n        end\n\n        thinlinc -- usr-sensXXX + 2FA + VPN ----&gt; SubGraph1Flow\n        terminal -- usr --&gt; Node1\n        terminal -- usr-sensXXX + 2FA + VPN ----&gt; SubGraph1Flow\n        Node1 -- usr-sensXXX + 2FA + no VPN ----&gt; SubGraph1Flow\n\n        subgraph \"Bianca\"\n        SubGraph1Flow(Bianca login) -- usr+passwd --&gt; private(private cluster)\n        private -- interactive --&gt; calcB(calculation nodes)\n        private -- sbatch --&gt; calcB\n        end\n\n        subgraph \"Rackham\"\n        Node1[Login] -- interactive --&gt; Node2[calculation nodes]\n        Node1 -- sbatch --&gt; Node2\n        end</code></pre>","tags":["lesson","session"]},{"location":"intermediate/practicalities/","title":"Practicalities","text":"","tags":["practicalities","prereqs","prerequisites","prepare","preparation"]},{"location":"intermediate/practicalities/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<ul> <li>SUPR/course project</li> <li> <p>set up 2FA</p> <ul> <li>2-factor authentication</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Use VPN outside Sunet.

To give ample time for exercises, in practice all of my topics took 30 minutes:</p> Lecture Scheduled Actual (minutes) Introduction 15 35 (NAISS-Sens) 20 25 Login 20 30 Command line intro 45 30 Module system 50 30 <p>I think changing the time to this was way better then just me talking.</p> <p>The form of the exercises can be improved: what I did is (1) introduce the page and exercises, (2) let the learners do the exercise, with a shared document for 'unsure answers' (i.e. an answer a learner wants me to check) and questions. I think the learners understood the exercise and actually worked on it. This way of doing exercises felt empty, i.e. there was not much for me to do, except talk, which was suboptimal as the learners need silence to think.</p> <p>Next time, put the learners in groups of 3 or 4 in breakout rooms.</p> <p>I did check the progress of the students as intended: by using the shared document. However, after the first exercise, no content was ever added to the shared document. This could by either due to link-fatigue, material being clear, the learners discovering that the answers can be dropped-down from the questions, the learners learning that I did not check progress by asking random learners, and/or me not discussing the results.</p> <p>I think I should discuss the results, by asking random students for answers or demonstrations. This would take more time, yet I feel there is plenty of time over the day.</p> <p>Next time, discuss the learners' results.</p> <p>The group had different backgrounds and I think I should have used that more, by putting them in groups. Also, I gave the quicker learners the next exercises too, which they could complete without help and I encouraged them for an early lunch.</p> <p>A non-solution would be to have this intro split by levels. Instead, put the learners in groups and let them profit of each other.</p> <p>The pace in my part was focused on the absolute beginners, as I sometimes waited for all learners to have finished an exercise and sometimes let helpers and/or other learners help these with a 1-on-1 session in a breakout room. I predict/hope that some learners will state in the evaluation stated that my part went too slow: this would mean I indeed do so. If some learners would state in the evaluation that my part went too fast, I would be surprised and attribute it to not using smaller groups (i.e. that learner expected/wanted/needed a 1-on-1).</p> <p>This would be my dream schedule:</p> From To What 9:00 10:00 Logging in 10:00 10:15 Break 10:15 11:00 Command-line 11:00 11:15 Break 11:15 12:00 Modules 12:00 13:00 Lunch 13:00 13:45 File transfer 13:45 14:00 Break 14:00 14:45 Interactive nodes, scheduling jobs 14:45 15:00 Break 15:00 15:30 Legal aspects of sensitive data 15:30 16:00 Optional Q&amp;A <p>Changes I suggest:</p> <ul> <li>I feel we should dive in immediately and all log in Bianca first!</li> <li>I feel the Overview page is nice, but needs not be discussed.

Due to this, we started at 14:30.</p> <p>I gave a 5 minute short monologue to IDEs after which I distributed the learners: Pavlin would have a break-out room on the Jupyter IDE, I would have one for RStudio. Due to an earlier poll at the start of the day, I knew these were the two major IDEs, hence showing VSCodium was not needed. Additionally, showing VSCodium was not needed as (1) it is even simpler than RStudio, and (2) I made a YouTube video about it.</p> <p>I am happy I distributed the learners: in my breakout room (I had a colleague 'hold the fort' in the main Zoom room) I had around six learners and I could have a short individual chat with them (I think 2 mins in total), after which I showed the course material and skipped through the YouTube video. I asked the learners for questions. One learner asked about using an interactive node: he never did that, as he was the only one in a project. With no questions left, I let the learners start RStudio on Bianca.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes, the learners found out that one couldn't login to the remote desktop. While sharing my screen, I shared this with the sysadmins. We discovered together that one could not log in, as someone was using the remote desktop node without using an interactive node (just like the learner I had!). I asked my learners if they were confident they could start RStudio on Bianca and the one learner with a camera claimed she was confident.</p> <p>At 15:05 we were done. We went to the general room for a general chat until Pavlin was ready. I encouraged the learners to look at Pavlins demo of Jupyter or stick around for a chat. I chatted with around 3 students until, around 15:15, Pavlins group returned and we had a coffee break.</p> <p>I think my teaching went well:</p> <ul> <li>(1) there was plenty of time for exercises,</li> <li>(2) I responded well to changes in schedule and breakdown of Bianca,</li> <li>(3) I had enough course material in place to allow a good response,</li> <li>(4) I had some real contact with some of the learners.</li> </ul> <p>While preparing the course material, I did more than just that:</p> <ul> <li>I added a section on transferring files using a GUI</li> <li>I made an overview of the course material and prerequisites</li> </ul> <p>I added a section on transferring files using a GUI, which is part of the 'Intro to Bianca' course. I added this section, as I felt this current section on file transfer was unsuitable for an Intro course. I needed a section about file transfer for beginners, as, in my course materials, I refer to earlier sections.</p> <p>I made an overview of the course material and prerequisites, as it helps me and colleagues decide on the order of topics, as well as what should be in either (i.e. basic or intermediate) course:</p> <p></p> <p>While writing this reflection, I changed it again:</p> <p></p> <p>I conclude that the intro course can have a minimal use of the terminal: only <code>chmod +x</code> (if the GUI cannot do this) and <code>sbatch</code> are really needed. My answer to 'What is the goal of the intro course?' would be:</p> <p>The goals of the introduction course is to allow a learner to use Bianca</p> <p>As most learners are most familiar with graphical user interfaces (i.e. not a terminal), we should use graphical user interfaces.</p> <p>Or the teaching goals of the introduction course:</p> <ul> <li>A learner can transfer a file</li> <li>A learner can modify and run code</li> <li>A learner can schedule a script</li> </ul> <p>Also here, use of the terminal should only be what is essential.</p> <p>My answer to 'What is the goal of the intermediate course?' would be:</p> <p>The goals of the intermediate course is to allow a learner to use Bianca more conveniently and/or efficiently</p> <p>Or the teaching goals of the intermediate course:</p> <ul> <li>A learner can run a job efficiently</li> <li>A learner can install custom software</li> </ul> <p>I hence think the introduction course can/should be simplified.

It is for sure the purpose of Transit to connect any two NAISS clusters, so mounting two 'wharfs' can/should be done there. How to mount a second NAISS cluster, I am unsure: I've never done that</li> </ul>","tags":["lesson","session"]}]}
